### RayEngine

This is a little raycaster engine in C++ and SFML.

You can find the source code at `src/Sources/main.cpp`
but the code is not really optimised.

The game can crash everytime, so be careful. Otherwise,
relaunch the game. There is a bug in the 2D view with a
ray which is doing some shit. I didn't totally patch it,
but a little bit.
